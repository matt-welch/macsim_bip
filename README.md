macsim_bip
==========

BIP cache protocol modificaitons to macsim

This is based entirely on the original macsim simulator with a few modifications 
to run a new cache-insertion policy, TAP_BIP.  

The original macsim v2.0 source was downloaded from https://code.google.com/p/macsim/downloads/list

This is based on some of the work done by Lee, et al in 
J. Lee and H. Kim, "TAP: A TLP-aware cache management policy for a CPU-GPU heterogeneous architecture," HPCA: IEEE 18th International Symposium High Performance COmputer Architecture, February 2012.
